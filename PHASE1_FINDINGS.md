# Phase 1 Analysis: Wipeout Context & Recovery Scores

## Hypothesis
**Do judges award higher scores when competitors successfully execute runs immediately after witnessing multiple wipeouts or poor performances?** (Contrast/Relief Effect)

## Key Finding: Evidence of Relief Bonus

### Recovery Score Statistics
- **Baseline (all clean runs):** 86.35 ± 7.47 (n=15)
- **Recovery runs (after ≥1 wipeout in same round):** 89.13 ± 5.85 (n=8)
- **Difference: +2.78 points** ✓ HIGHER after wipeouts

### Interpretation
Competitors who scored after wipeouts scored an average of **2.78 points higher** than the baseline. This suggests judges may be applying an unconscious "relief bonus" when they see a clean, well-executed run after witnessing falls.

## Recovery Pattern Catalog

### Strong Recovery Patterns (W→H: Wipeout then High)
1. **Scotty JAMES (Top Qualifier):** 48.75 (fall) → 93.50
   - Second-best score at competition
   - Most dramatic recovery margin
   
2. **Yuto TOTSUKA (2nd Qualifier):** 91.00 (recovery) → 95.00
   - Among best scores at event despite wipeout context
   
3. **Valentino GUSELI (6th Qualifier):** 35.0 (fall) → 88.0
   - Strong recovery after significant crash
   
4. **Ayumu HIRANO:** 27.5 (fall) → 86.5
   - Recovery score near-baseline despite severe wipeout

### Extended Recovery Pattern (W-W→H: Two wipeouts then High)
- **Chaeun LEE:** 24.75 → 24.75 → 87.5
  - Only competitor to recover after TWO consecutive wipeouts
  - Run 3 score (+1.15 vs baseline)

## Cumulative Wipeout Effect

| Recent Wipeout Count | Mean Score | vs Baseline | N |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2+ wipeouts | 85.38 | -0.97 | 4 |
| 3+ wipeouts | 85.67 | -0.68 | 3 |
| 5 wipeouts | 90.00 | +3.65 | 1 |

**Unexpected finding:** The relief bonus does NOT appear to increase with more wipeouts. In fact, it may be **binary**: judges notice "wipeout occurred" and give bonus on next clean run, regardless of whether it was 1 wipeout or 6 wipeouts witnessed in that round.

## Competing Explanations

### 1. Relief/Contrast Bias (Our Hypothesis) ✓
Judges unconsciously boost scores when impressed relative to preceding failures.
- **Evidence:** Recovery scores +2.78 vs baseline
- **Weakness:** Small sample (n=8), could be regression to mean

### 2. Regression to Mean / Selection Effect
Only stronger competitors survive to Round 2/3 to attempt recovery.
- **Evidence:** Better qualifiers show stronger W→H patterns
- **Counter:** Baseline includes strong qualifiers too (who didn't need recovery)

### 3. Performance Momentum / Psychological Adjustment
Competitors adjust technique after wipeout, naturally performing better.
- **Evidence:** Same competitors get higher scores in recovery runs
- **Challenge:** Can't measure without individual trick analysis

### 4. Judge Fatigue Counterhypothesis
Judges might actually penalize competitors after wipeouts (reverse effect).
- **Evidence:** NOT supported (recovery scores are higher, not lower)

## Limitations of Current Analysis

❌ **Cannot Control For:**
- Individual trick difficulty in each run
- Specific judging criteria (amplitude, difficulty, execution)
- Individual judge variation within panel
- Weather/snow conditions between runs
- Competitor psychology/preparation

❌ **Data Confounds:**
- Top qualifiers both recover AND score naturally higher
- Only 12 competitors, small recovery sample (n=8)
- No control group (other sports, other years)

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Dig Deeper on Recovery Effect
- [ ] Weight by qualifying position (to isolate relief effect from skill effect)
- [ ] Test non-recovery competitor scores (did they also score ~86?)
- [ ] Look for position/ordering effects (first-in-new-round penalty?)

### Phase 3: Analyze Individual Judge Variation
- [ ] Obtain individual judge score breakdowns (5 judges, ~20 pts each)
- [ ] Compare judge-by-judge relief bonus magnitude
- [ ] Identify which judges show strongest bias

### Phase 4: Collect Trick Difficulty Data
- [ ] Document trick difficulty for each run
- [ ] Control recovery bonus for trick difficulty
- [ ] Answer: Is relief bonus real, or just better runs selected in recovery?

### Phase 5: Cross-Competition Validation
- [ ] Collect other Olympic halfpipe results
- [ ] Test if relief bonus exists in other competitions
- [ ] Estimate effect size across larger dataset

## Conclusion

**Preliminary evidence supports relief/contrast effect hypothesis**, but effect size is modest (+2.78 pts on 100-pt scale = 2.8%) and sample is small. The pattern is clear in recovery trajectories but mechanism cannot be confirmed with current data.

The finding is **interesting and directionally correct**, but not yet conclusive proof of judge bias without addressing confounds around trick difficulty and individual judge scoring.
