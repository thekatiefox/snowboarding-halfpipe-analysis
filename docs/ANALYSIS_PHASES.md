# Analysis Phases: Wipeout Context & Relief Bias

## Phase 1: Evidence of Relief Bonus

### Key Finding

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Baseline (all clean runs) | 86.35 ± 7.47 (n=15) |
| Recovery runs (after ≥1 wipeout) | 89.13 ± 5.85 (n=8) |
| **Difference** | **+2.78 points** |

Competitors who scored after wipeouts scored an average of **2.78 points higher** than baseline. This suggested judges may apply an unconscious "relief bonus" when they see a clean run after witnessing falls.

### Strong Recovery Patterns

1. **Scotty JAMES (Top Qualifier):** 48.75 (fall) → 93.50 (+44.75)
   - Second-best score at competition, most dramatic recovery
   
2. **Yuto TOTSUKA (2nd Qualifier):** 91.00 → 95.00 (+4.00)
   - Among best scores despite wipeout context
   
3. **Valentino GUSELI:** 35.0 (fall) → 88.0 (+53.0)
   - Strong recovery after significant crash
   
4. **Ayumu HIRANO:** 27.5 (fall) → 86.5 (+59.0)
   - Recovery score near-baseline despite severe wipeout

5. **Chaeun LEE:** 24.75 → 24.75 → 87.5 (+62.75)
   - Only competitor to recover after TWO consecutive wipeouts

### Cumulative Wipeout Effect

| Preceding Wipeout Count | Mean Score | vs Baseline | N |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2+ wipeouts | 85.38 | -0.97 | 4 |
| 3+ wipeouts | 85.67 | -0.68 | 3 |
| 5 wipeouts | 90.00 | +3.65 | 1 |

**Unexpected finding**: Relief bonus does NOT increase with more wipeouts. May be **binary**: judges notice "wipeout occurred" and give bonus on next clean run, regardless of count.

### Competing Explanations (Phase 1)

1. **Relief/Contrast Bias** — Judges unconsciously boost scores after witnessing failures
   - Evidence: Recovery scores +2.78 vs baseline
   - Weakness: Small sample (n=8), could be regression to mean

2. **Regression to Mean / Selection Effect** — Only stronger competitors survive to attempt recovery
   - Evidence: Better qualifiers show stronger W→H patterns
   - Counter: Baseline includes strong qualifiers too

3. **Performance Momentum** — Competitors adjust technique after wipeout, naturally performing better
   - Evidence: Same competitors score higher in recovery runs
   - Challenge: Can't measure without individual trick analysis

## Phase 2: Skill Control & Critical Discovery

### The Problem: Selection Bias in Wipeout Context

Bottom qualifiers **go first in each round**, so they **never have wipeouts before them within a round**. This means:
- Zero recovery runs in bottom tier (can't recover from what didn't happen)
- Recovery effect only visible in middle/top tiers (who go later)
- **This is a fundamental structural confound** we didn't anticipate

### Wipeout Rates by Tier

| Tier | Position | Wipeout Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Bottom | 1-4 | 41.7% (5/12 runs) |
| Middle | 5-8 | 25.0% (3/12 runs) |
| Top | 9-12 | 8.3% (1/12 runs) |

Better qualifiers wipeout less frequently, reducing recovery opportunities.

### Within-Tier Analysis: Relief Effect DISAPPEARS

| Tier | Baseline Runs | Recovery Runs | Relief Bonus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bottom** | 4 runs (77.81 avg) | 0 runs | N/A - goes first each round |
| **Middle** | 2 runs (89.50 avg) | 3 runs (88.83 avg) | **-0.67 pts** (slight penalty) |
| **Top** | 1 run (92.00) | 5 runs (89.30 avg) | **-2.70 pts** (slight penalty) |

### Uncomfortable Finding

**Across tiers, recovery runs are LOWER than baseline, not higher.** This contradicts Phase 1's +2.78 point relief bonus.

### Why the Contradiction?

Phase 1 found +2.78 bonus when comparing recovery vs overall baseline (86.35). Phase 2 found penalties when controlling for skill:

1. **Recovery runners tend to be better qualifiers** (positions 5-12)
2. **Better qualifiers naturally score higher** (89+ range)
3. **When we filter by tier, we remove this advantage**
4. **Result: relief effect disappears or reverses**

**Conclusion**: Phase 1's +2.78 bonus was **masking a skill effect**, not real judge bias.

### Detailed Recovery Patterns

#### Middle Tier (Pos 5-8)
- **Ayumu HIRANO (R2):** 86.50 (after 2 wipeouts) — 3.0 pts below tier baseline
- **Ruka HIRANO (R1):** 90.00 (after 6 wipeouts) — 0.5 pts above tier baseline ✓
- **Ruka HIRANO (R2):** 90.00 (after 2 wipeouts) — 0.5 pts above tier baseline ✓

#### Top Tier (Pos 9-12)
- **Alessandro BARBIERI (R1):** 75.00 (after 6 wipeouts) — 17.0 pts BELOW tier baseline ✗
- **Ryusei YAMADA (R1):** 92.00 (after 6 wipeouts) — on tier baseline
- **Yuto TOTSUKA (R1):** 91.00 (after 6 wipeouts) — 1.0 pt below baseline
- **Yuto TOTSUKA (R2):** 95.00 (after 2 wipeouts) — **+3.0 pts above baseline ✓** (strongest)
- **Scotty JAMES (R2):** 93.50 (after 2 wipeouts) — **+1.5 pts above baseline ✓** (modest)

### New Pattern: Round Matters

- **R1** (after many wipeouts): Top qualifiers show penalty or neutral effect
- **R2** (after fewer wipeouts): Top qualifiers show relief bonus (+1-3 pts)

**Possible explanation**: Judges fatigued after R1's chaos, or relief effect only manifests with fewer wipeouts to compare.

## What Changed Between Phases

| Finding | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Relief effect size | +2.78 pts | -0.67 to -2.70 pts (within tier) |
| Effect consistency | Across all competitors | Only in R2, specific competitors |
| Mechanism | Judge lenience | Selection bias masking skill effect |
| Conclusion | Preliminary evidence | Largely skill effect, not judge bias |

---

## Remaining Confounds

✗ **Skill composition**: Not enough data to fully separate relief from performer skill
✗ **Trick difficulty**: Don't know if recovery runs involve easier tricks
✗ **Judge psychology by round**: Are judges more lenient/strict as rounds progress?
✗ **DNI ambiguity**: Unknown if DNI = crash or didn't improve on high score (see METHODOLOGY.md)
✗ **Sample size**: Only 8 total recovery runs (3 middle tier, 5 top tier)

---

## Key Takeaway

**Phase 1's relief effect was largely a skill effect**, not judges being lenient. The pattern is more nuanced than "judges give relief bonuses." It may depend on:
- Number of wipeouts witnessed
- Round number
- Competitor skill level
- Specific circumstances

## Next Steps

1. **Separate by round**: Analyze R1 vs R2 vs R3 effects in detail
2. **Examine position ordering**: Do top qualifiers suffer when going after elites?
3. **Look for judge-by-judge patterns**: Is effect real or specific judges?
4. **Collect trick difficulty**: Control for what was actually performed
