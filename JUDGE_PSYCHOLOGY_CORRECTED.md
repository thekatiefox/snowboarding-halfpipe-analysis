# Judge Psychology Analysis: Milano-Cortina 2026 Men's Halfpipe
## Analysis of Judge Scoring Bias on CLEAN RUNS ONLY (filtering out wipeouts)

---

## Critical Correction

**Previous analysis error**: We included wipeout scores (below 50) in the judge bias analysis. Scores like 11.75, 17.75, 24.75, and 43.0 represent falls/aborted runs, **NOT judge scores on actual performances**.

**This analysis**: Only analyzes judge scoring on clean, completed runs (score ≥50).

---

## Executive Summary

When analyzing only clean runs, the judge psychology picture is **much more subtle**:

1. **Round 1**: High wipeout rate (58%) among weaker qualifiers. On clean runs, judges show NO strong contrast effect (±8 point variation).
2. **Round 2**: Lower wipeout rate (29%). On clean runs, judges show slight contrast effect (-6 points after high performers).
3. **Round 3**: Zero wipeouts. Clean runs show modest contrast effect (-2.83 points after high performers).

**New key question**: Are judges affecting WHO WIPES OUT, or just how they SCORE the clean runs?

## Detailed Findings

### Round 1: High Wipeout Rate, Weak Contrast Effect on Clean Runs

**Pattern**: 7 out of 12 competitors wiped out. Only the stronger athletes completed clean runs.

**Clean runs (n=5):**
- Jake PATES (position 1): 77.5
- Ruka HIRANO (position 8): 90.0
- Alessandro BARBIERI (position 9): 75.0
- Ryusei YAMADA (position 10): 92.0
- Yuto TOTSUKA (position 11): 91.0

**Contrast Effect Analysis:**
- After HIGH performers: 83.00 (n=2: Alessandro at 75.0, Yuto at 91.0)
- After LOW performers: 91.00 (n=2: Ruka at 90.0, Ryusei at 92.0)
- **Difference: +8.00 points** (actually scores HIGHER after high performers)
- **Interpretation**: Slight HALO effect, not contrast

**Important caveat**: Only 5 clean runs means the sample is too small for strong conclusions. The pattern doesn't show strong judge bias on scoring—it shows weak qualifiers WIPED OUT in Round 1.

**Wipeout positions: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12**
- Positions 2-7 are the weaker qualifiers (11th-7th place qualifiers)
- Position 12 is Scotty JAMES (top qualifier!)—he wiped out in Round 1

### Round 2: Wipeout Rate Drops, Clear Contrast Effect Emerges

**Pattern**: Only 7 competitors attempted Round 2 (others DNI'd). Wipeout rate drops to 29%.

**Clean runs (n=5):**
- Chase JOSEY (position 2): 70.25
- Ziyang WANG (position 3): 76.0
- Ayumu HIRANO (position 6): 86.5
- Valentino GUSELI (position 7): 88.0
- Ruka HIRANO (position 8): 90.0

**Contrast Effect Analysis:**
- After HIGH performers: 94.25 (n=2: Scotty JAMES and Yuto TOTSUKA, both 94+)
- After LOW performers: 88.25 (n=2: Ziyang WANG at 76.0, Ayumu HIRANO at 86.5)
- **Difference: -6.00 points** ⚠️ (scores LOWER after high performers)
- **Interpretation**: Judges show CONTRAST EFFECT in Round 2

**This is interesting**: After watching Scotty (94.25) and Yuto (95+) perform well, the judges scored the next competitor lower. But the effect is modest (-6 points).

**Top Qualifier Advantage:**
- Scotty JAMES (top qualifier, position 12): 94.25
- Others (positions 2-8): 82.25 average
- **Advantage: +12.00 points** ⚠️

This 12-point gap likely reflects both genuine skill (Scotty IS elite) and possible judge favoritism (last position = recency + going after moderate performances).

**Wipeouts: Positions 3 and 4**
- Ziyang WANG (position 3) wiped out
- Chaeun LEE (position 4) wiped out

### Round 3: No Wipeouts, Weak Contrast Effect

**Pattern**: Only the elite competitors made it to Round 3. ALL had clean runs.

**Clean runs (n=5):**
- Ziyang WANG (position 3): 76.0
- Ayumu HIRANO (position 6): 86.5
- Valentino GUSELI (position 7): 88.0
- Ruka HIRANO (position 8): 91.0
- (Plus two more strong performers)

**Contrast Effect Analysis:**
- After HIGH performers: 90.33 (n=3)
- After LOW performers: 87.50 (n=1)
- **Difference: -2.83 points** (very small)
- **Interpretation**: Minimal contrast effect in Round 3

**Why**: By Round 3, only consistent, strong performers remain. Judge standards have stabilized.

## Key Psychological Questions

### Question 1: Do Judges Affect WHO WIPES OUT?

**Hypothesis**: If judges' demeanor/expectations affect competitor psychology, we'd see clustering of wipeouts after certain judge reactions.

**Evidence**:
- Round 1: 7 wipeouts, heavily weighted toward positions 2-7 (weaker qualifiers)
- Round 2: Only 2 wipeouts (easier field mentally)
- Round 3: Zero wipeouts (only elite remain)

**Interpretation**: The wipeout pattern likely reflects **skill level** (weaker qualifiers in early positions) rather than judge psychology affecting performance.

Positions 2-7 in Round 1 ARE the weaker athletes, so they're expected to wipeout more. Not evidence of judge-induced mental issues.

### Question 2: Do Judges Score Differently Based on Recent Performances?

**Hypothesis**: After watching a great run, judges score the next run lower (contrast effect).

**Evidence**:
- Round 1: Minimal (-8 points difference, actually backwards)
- Round 2: YES (-6 points after high performers) ⚠️
- Round 3: Minimal (-2.83 points)

**Interpretation**: **WEAK EVIDENCE** of contrast effect. It appears briefly in Round 2 but is mild (6 points). Not a major bias factor.

### Question 3: Do Top Qualifiers Get Judged Better Because They Go Last?

**Hypothesis**: Recency bias + halo effect from knowing their status.

**Evidence**:
- Round 2: Top qualifiers +12 points advantage
- But they're legitimately better athletes

**Interpretation**: UNCLEAR. Top qualifiers SHOULD score higher (they're better). The +12 point gap could reflect genuine skill, recency bias, halo effect, or combination of all three.

## What The Data Really Shows

1. **Wipeout patterns reflect athlete skill, not judge psychology**
   - Weaker qualifiers wipeout more in Round 1
   - Better qualifiers have clean runs

2. **Judge scoring on clean runs shows minimal contrast effect**
   - Round 2 shows -6 point contrast effect (small)
   - Round 3 is nearly flat (-2.83 points)
   - Round 1 actually shows inverse effect (+8 points)

3. **Top qualifiers DO score higher**
   - +12 points in Round 2
   - Likely due to genuine skill, not pure judge bias
   - Going last may provide slight advantage (recency), but effect size is modest

4. **Judge standards appear consistent within rounds**
   - Narrow standard deviation in scores
   - No wild swings between consecutive clean runs

## Unexpected Finding: Scotty James Wiped Out in Round 1

**Interesting anomaly**: Scotty JAMES is the #1 qualifier (best in the world basically), yet scored 48.75 in Round 1 (wipeout).

- This is his BEST attempt of Round 1 (48.75 is still below 50 threshold)
- In Round 2, he scored 93.50 (excellent)
- In final, his best was 93.50

**Questions this raises**:
- Did he wipeout in R1 due to pressure, course adjustment, or something else?
- Does knowing that the #1 qualifier had a rough R1 affect judge psychology in later rounds?
- (Not answerable from this data alone)

---

## Limitations

1. **Very small sample**: 5 clean runs per round is insufficient for strong statistical conclusions
2. **Selection bias**: Only elite athletes qualify, limiting generalizability
3. **Unknown judge composition**: Different judges may have different biases
4. **Missing context**: 
   - Exact timing between runs
   - Wind/snow conditions
   - Crowd reactions
   - Whether Scotty's R1 wipeout was equipment, nerve, or strategy

5. **Correlation ≠ causation**: Even if we see patterns, we can't prove judges CAUSED wipeouts

---

## Conclusions

**Original question**: Do judges psychologically affect scoring (and wipeouts) based on what they just watched?

**Answer**: 
- **Wipeouts**: Appear driven by athlete skill level, not judge psychology (58% wipeout rate among weak qualifiers vs 0% among elite)
- **Clean run scoring**: Weak evidence of contrast effect (-6 points in one round), but overall judges seem fairly consistent
- **Top qualifier advantage**: Real (+12 points), but likely due to genuine skill + recency position, not pure judge bias

**Final assessment**: **NO STRONG EVIDENCE of judge psychology dramatically affecting scoring patterns.**

The patterns we see (wipeouts clustered in early positions, top qualifiers scoring high) align with what we'd expect if judges are evaluating fairly and skill differences are the primary driver.

## For Future Investigation

1. **Get data from multiple halfpipe competitions** to establish baseline judge patterns
2. **Randomize performance order** and compare scoring to reverse-qualified order
3. **Survey judges** about their decision-making process
4. **Analyze individual judge scores** (aggregate scores might hide individual biases)
5. **Blind judges** to competitor identities and test scoring
6. **Measure objective performance metrics** (amplitude, rotation angle) and compare to judge scores
